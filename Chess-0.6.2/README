Chess version 0.6.0
===================

Chess 0.6.0 is a complete rewrite of Chess based on bug reports I've received
as well as a desire to produce something a lot less 'hack-ish' than 0.5.2.
I read Damian Conway's excellent book "Object-Oriented Perl" as a refresher
prior to starting work on this version, and I'm very please with the results.

While this version is still in development, it's unlikely that I'm going to
change anything here; rather, there are plans to add to this framework before
ultimately producing a 1.0 version. The TODO file contains a list of features
I'd like to see in 1.0. Please let me know if you can help with any of it.

Happy hacking!
