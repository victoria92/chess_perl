Chess version 0.6.0 TODO
========================

This version essentially covers all the rules of Chess. It does not, however,
have the ability to determine that a game has been drawn by three-fold
repetition. I would require a hashing function that can hash a particular
board position into a unique key. Once this hashing function has been
designed, this last rule can be put into place.

For the 1.0 release, I would like to include these features:
- a framework for writing an analysis of a board position, complete with
  memoization so that expensive operations can be cached for every board
  position that's been seen before
- compatability with Chess Engine communication protocols so that this
  object-oriented Chessboard could communicate with GNU chess
